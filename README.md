## Download R3VAI.cpp or Copy/Paste

### If Downloaded
- Windows: Open in **Visual Studio** and run.  
- Linux: Compile using `g++ R3VAI.cpp -o R3VAI` and then run `./R3VAI`.

### If Copy/Pasted
- Replit: Paste the code and run.  
- Windows: Paste into **Visual Studio** and run.  
- Linux: Paste into a text editor, save as `R3VAI.cpp`, then compile and run as above.

## How It Works
R3VAI downloads required data files (such as response sets) at runtime.  
These downloads are necessary for proper functionality.

## Requirements
- Active internet connection
- Download permissions enabled at runtime
- C++ compiler (Visual Studio on Windows, g++ on Linux, or Replit environment)

## Development
- Written and tested on Replit
- Actively in development; features may change
